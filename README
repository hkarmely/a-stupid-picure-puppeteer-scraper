a very stupid but fun image scraper
all you need to do is to insert the url you wand to scrape from in line 7 (within quotes)
then to run "npm i" int the root folder to install the node modules 
and than run "npm start"

* you sould have nodemon installed to run this
so if you do not have nodemon you could install it or just run "node index.js" instead
